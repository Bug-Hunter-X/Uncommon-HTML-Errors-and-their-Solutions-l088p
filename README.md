# Uncommon HTML Errors

This repository demonstrates some uncommon HTML errors and their solutions.  The `bug.html` file contains the errors, while `bugSolution.html` shows the corrected code.  The errors include broken links, a missing closing div tag and an unclosed script tag, all of which can lead to unexpected rendering or browser console errors.
